//! Problem 1
    //console.log(randomCar) = Tesla
    //console.log(otherRandomCar) = Mercedes

//! Problem 2
    //console.log(otherName); = Elon
    //console.log(employeeName); = employeeName is not defined

//! Problem 3
    //console.log(password); = 12345
    //console.log(hashedPassword); undefined

//! Problem 4
    //console.log(first === second); = False
    //console.log(first === third); = True

//! Problem 5
    //console.log(key); = value
    //console.log(secondKey); = [1, 5, 1, 8, 3, 3]
    //console.log(secondKey[0]); = 1
    //console.log(willThisWork); = 5

//! Problem 6
    //var beatles = ['Paul', 'George', 'John', 'Ringo']; is a global scope
    //we have 2 functions printNames() and actuallyPrintingNames() 
    //actuallyPrintingNames() function is nested inside printNames() and has access to the names parameter
    //so we have a for loop so the output is :

    //Paul was found at index 0
    //George was found at index 1
    //John was found at index 2
    //Ringo was found at index 3

    //after the for loop in actuallyPrintingNames() function,     
    // console.log('name and index after loop is ' + name + ':' + index); is Ringo and index 3 (the correct index is 4)


//! Problem 7
    // names is not defined and no invoking to the function (we only call it) so the code is not complete
    

//! Problem 8
    //Paul was found at index 0
    //George was found at index 1
    //John was found at index 2
    //Ringo was found at index 3

//! Problem 9
    //console.log(planet.composition[0] === planetCopy.composition[0]) = True
    //console.log(planet === planetCopy) = False ===> here we have a spread operator (const planetCopy = {...planet} )
    //so planet and planetCopy are 2 differents objects in memory also they have different reference
